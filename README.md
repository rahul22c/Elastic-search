# Elastic-search
Hands on elastic search

Working on application of elastic search. 

A simple webpage is designed where user can query for keywords in the files ( saved in files folder). Elastic search will run the query to give the results.

Some formating/preprocessing of document is done before indexing it. Still working to get a clean document which doesnot require preprocessing 

Using python client for elastic search
