# Elastic-search
Hands on elastic search

Working on application of elastic search. 

A simple webpage is designed where user can query for keywords in the files ( saved in files folder). Elastic search will run the query to give the results.

Some formating/preprocessing of document is done before indexing it. Still working to get a clean document which doesnot require preprocessing 

Files, indexing and main are pre run on computer to setup database.

Server and query are run to setup a webpage and take quey requests.
