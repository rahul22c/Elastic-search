The respondents' appeal  to the<br>District  Court was dismissed. The District  Court  directed<br>the  appellant to deposit purchase money by a  certaindate<br>and  directed  the  respondents on thedeposit to  deliver<br>possession  of the property.  There was also a direction  in<br>the  decree that in case the amount was not paid on the due<br>date  the  suit shallstand  dismissed  withcosts. The<br>respondents preferred a second appeal to the High Court and<br>pending disposal of the appeal the respondents prayed for<br>stay  of  the execution decree. Before the date  fixed for<br>depositing  the purchase money the High  Court stayed the<br>execution  of the decree of the lower appellate court. The<br>appellant deposited the purchase price 3 days after the date<br>fixed  stating that he could not deposit in time as hefell<br>ill.  Thereafter the High Court dismissed the second appeal,<br>and  the appellant, obtained possession of  the properties.<br>The   respondents  applied  tothe  Executing Court for<br>restitution  of properties on the ground that the  appellant<br>had defaulted in depositing, the purchase money by thedate<br>fixed by the lower appellate court's decree.  The  appellant<br>contended that the stay order made by the High Court in the<br>secondappeal prevented him from acting in accordancewith<br>the terms of the lower appellate court's decree, and in any<br>case the High Court had dismissed the second appeal and the<br>decreeholderwould get by necessary implication  a  fresh<br>starting  point for depositing the purchase amount from the<br>Sate of the High Court's decree.The Executing Court rejected<br>the  claim of the respondents for restitution.This  decision<br>was  affirmed, on appeal by the District Court.But theHigh<br>Court  in appeal, took the' view that there was default  on<br>the  part  of the appellant indepositing theamount and<br>therefore   the  appellant'ssuit   stood   dismissed<br>automatically  and the appellant was-not therefore  entitled<br>to possession in enforcement of the pre-emption decree.<br>    HELD: The appeal must be allowed.<br>    A  decree in terms of 0.20 r. 14, Civil  ProcedureCode<br>imposes  obligations  on  both sidesand  they   are  so<br>conditioned  that  performanceby  one is  conditional  on<br>performance  by the  other.  To put  it   differently, the<br>obligations  are. reciprocal and are inter-linked,  sothat<br>they  cannot be separated.  If the defendants  by  obtaining<br>the stay order from the High Court relieve themselves of the<br>obligation  todeliver possession ofthe  properties the<br>plaintiff-decree  holder must also be deemed thereby  to  be<br>relieved of the necessity of depositing the money so long as<br>the stay order continue. [517 D, E]<br>    The effect of the order of the High Court dismissing the<br>secondappeal was to give by necessary implication a  fresh<br>starting point<br>515<br>depositing  the amount from the date of  the  High  Court's<br>decreeand  the appellant could have deposited the  amount<br>immediately   after  the  HighCourt's decree.   But the<br>appellant  had deposited the amount before the date  of the<br>High Court's decree and there was no default on the part  of<br>the  appellantin fulfilling the terms of  the pre-emption<br>decree.

Narsaraju and R.V. Pillai, for the appellant.<br>M.S.K. Sastri and M.S. Narasimhan, for respondent No. 1. The<br>Judgment of the Court was delivered by-<br>Ramaswami,  J. This appeal is brought, by special leave,  on<br>behalf of the .plaintiff against the judgment of the  Bombay<br>High  Court dated October 11/14,  1963 in Appeal No.  30  of<br>1962  from  the appellate  order  of  the  District  Court,<br>Osmanabad  whereby the High Court reversed thejudgment  of<br>the  lower  courts and declared that the appellant  was not<br>entitled to execute the decree for pre-emption and that the<br>respondents  were  entitled to be put in possession  of the<br>properties   of  which they  were  dispossessed   in the<br>enforcement of the pre-emption decree.<br>    The appellant had obtained a decree for  possession  of<br>certain lands in a pre-emption suit he had brought  against<br>the respondents.  The decree was made in March, 1945 and the<br>appellant was directed to pay the consideration of Rs. 5,000<br>withinsix months from the date of the decree on which the<br>appellant was to be put in possession of the suit lands.  In<br>case  of default in depositing the sum within the  time the<br>plaintiff's  suit was to be deemed to have  been  dismissed.<br>The  respondents preferred an appeal to the  District  Court<br>against the  decree but the District  Court  confirmed the<br>decreeon  January 28, 1955.  The amount of Rs.  5,000 was<br>deposited  in  Court by the appellant on December  20,1954<br>withinthe time granted in the trial court's decree but  it<br>was subsequently withdrawn by him under orders of the Court.<br>Whiledismissing  the appeal of  the   respondents and<br>confirming  the decree for pre-emption, the  District  Court<br>directed the appellant to deposit the sum of Rs. 5,000 on or<br>beforeApril 30, 1955 and directed the respondents onsuch<br>deposit to deliver possession of the properties.  There was<br>also  a direction in the decree that in case the amount was<br>not paid on the due date the suit shall stand dismissed with<br>costs.The decree was passed in conformity with O.20,r.14<br>of  the Civil Procedure Code.  The respondentspreferred  a<br>Second Appeal to the High Court and<br>516<br>pending disposal of the appeal the respondents prayed for<br>stay  of the execution decree.On March 23, 1955  theHigh<br>Court passed the stay order in the following terms:<br> "Stayof execution of decree of the  lower<br>      appellate court is granted on conditionthat<br>      the appellant furnishes security to the extent<br>      of the amount of costs."<br>The order was received by the trial court on April 19, 1955.<br>The appellant who was directed under the terms of the  lower<br>appellate court's decree to deposit the sum of Rs. 5,000  on<br>or  before  April 30, 1955 made default in  depositing the<br>amounton that date. He, however, deposited the  amount  on<br>May  2, 1955.Since  the deposit  was not  made  intime<br>according   tothe  lower  appellate  court's decree  an<br>application  was filed along with the deposit  statingthat<br>the  amount could not be paid in time as the appellantfell<br>ill.  The Second Appeal preferred by the respondents to the<br>High  Court  was dismissed on October 6, 1960 and  thepre-<br>emption decree in favour of the appellant  was  confirmed.<br>Thereafter  onFebruary  3,  1961  the appellant  flied  a<br>Darkhast  for possession of the suit properties.  Since the<br>application  was  within a year of the decree  of  theHigh<br>Court  a warrant for possession was issued by the  Executing<br>Court  without notice to the respondents and  the  appellant<br>also obtained possession of a portion of the suit properties<br>under  the  aforesaid  warrant. On February  8,   1961 the<br>respondents filed an application in the Executing Court for<br>restitution  of the properties taken possession of  by the<br>appellant on the ground that the appellant had defaulted  in<br>depositing the purchase money on or before April 30, 1955 as<br>required  by  the  lower appellate court's  decree  and the<br>Executing  Court  was in error in issuing  thewarrant for<br>possession  ofthe suit properties.   The  application for<br>restitution  was  contested by the appellant on the  ground<br>that  the  stay order made by the High Court in the  Second<br>Appealprevented  him from acting in  accordance  with the<br>terms of the lower appellate court's decree and in anycase<br>the  High  Court  had dismissed the Second  Appeal  and the<br>decree-holder  would  get by necessary implication  a  fresh<br>starting  point for depositing the purchase amount from the<br>date  of  the  High Court's  decree.   The  Executing  Court<br>rejected  the claim of the respondents for  restitution and<br>'allowed  the  execution case of the appellantto  proceed.<br>Against this order of the Executing Court  the respondents<br>went up in appeal to the District Court which dismissed the<br>appeal and confirmed the order of the Executing Court. The<br>respondents  thereafter took the matter in Second Appeal  to<br>the  Bombay High Court which differed from the view  of the<br>District Court and allowed the appeal.The High Courttook<br>the view that there was default on the part of the appellant<br>in depositing the amount and therefore the appellant's<br>517<br>suit stood dismissed automatically and the appellant was not<br>therefore entitled to possession in enforcement of thepre-<br>emption decree.<br>    The first question arising in this appeal is whether the<br>High  Court was right in taking the view that the effect  of<br>the  stay order dated March 23, 1955 was merely to stay the<br>delivery  of  possession by the judgment-debtors and  not  a<br>stay  with  regard to the deposit of purchase price  by the<br>decree-holder.In our opinion, the High Court was in  error<br>in  taking this view. The decree framed under O.20,  r. 14,<br>CivilProcedure  Code requires  reciprocalrights and<br>obligations  between  the parties.  The rule  says  that  on<br>payment into court of the purchase money the defendant shall<br>deliver possession  of the property to the  plaintiff. The<br>decree holder therefore deposits the purchase money with the<br>expectation  that in return the possession of  the  property<br>would  be  delivered to him.  It is therefore clear  that  a<br>decree in terms of O.20, r.14; Civil Procedure Code  imposes<br>obligations  on both sides and they are so conditionedthat<br>performance  by one is conditional onperformance  by the<br>other. To put it differently, the obligations are reciprocal<br>and are inter-linked, so that they cannot be separated.  If<br>the  defendants by obtaining the stay order from  theHigh<br>Court  relievethemselves  ofthe  obligation to  deliver<br>possession  ofthe properties the  plaintiff-decree  holder<br>must also be deemed thereby to be relieved of the  necessity<br>of depositing the money so long as the stay order continues.<br>We  are accordingly of the opinion that the order  ofstay<br>dated  March 23, 1955 must be construed as an order  staying<br>the whole procedure of sale including delivery of possession<br>as  well as payment of price.  The effect of the stay  order<br>therefore  in  the present case is to enlarge the  time for<br>payment till the decision of the appeal.<br>    Weare  further of the opinion that the effect  of the<br>order  of the High Court dated October 6,   1960  dismissing<br>the  Second  Appeal was to give by necessary  implication  a<br>fresh starting point for depositing the amount from the date<br>of  the High Court's decree.  The decree of the High  Court<br>was  dated  October  6, 1960 and the  appellant couldhave<br>deposited  the amount immediately after this date.  But the<br>appellant  hasdeposited the amount on May 2, 1955,long<br>beforethe date of the High Court's decree and there is  no<br>default on the part of the appellant in fulfilling the terms<br>of  the pre-emption decree.  In the present case,  when the<br>High  Court  dealt  with  the Second  Appeal  filed  by the<br>respondents, the time limited by the trial court for  making<br>the deposit had expired.  It was open to the respondents  to<br>press this point in the Second Appeal and for the High Court<br>to decide that, the time having expired, it was not open  to<br>the  plaintiffto make the deposit and therewas  nothing<br>before the<br>518<br>High  Court for decision.  It was equally open to  theHigh<br>Court  to dismiss the appeal and expressly extend  thetime<br>for making the deposit. When the High Court refrainedfrom<br>following  the first course and confirmed the trial  court's<br>decree, what was its intention ?  Surely it wanted togive<br>the plaintiff an effective decree in his favour.  If so,  we<br>are  justifiedin holding that the High Courtintended  to<br>exercise  its  power of extending the time  for making the<br>deposit,  and  incorporated  in its  decree  the   relevant<br>provisions  ofthe trial court's decree.  That is  tosay,<br>this  is a case in which we must hold that a fresh  starting<br>point  is  implied in the decree of the High  Court  in the<br>Second Appeal. The view that we have expressed is borne out<br>by  the decision  of  the  Bombay  High  Court in  Satwaji<br>Balajiray Deshamukh v.Sakharlal Atmatarnsher(1).  Inthat<br>case, the plaintiff brought a suit to recover possession  of<br>property  as purchaser from defendants 1 to 6 and to  redeem<br>the  mortgage  of  defendant  7.   Thefirst  court  having<br>dismissed  thesuit, the appellate  court,  on plaintiff's<br>appeal, passed a decree directing the plaintiff to  recover<br>possession on payment to defendants 1 to 6 of a certain sum<br>withinsix months from the date of its decree and  then  to<br>redeemdefendant 7, and on the plaintiff's failure  to pay<br>withinsix  months from the date of the  decree  he  should<br>forfeit his right to recover possession. All parties  being<br>dissatisfied  with  the decree, the  plaintiffpreferred  a<br>secondappealto  the High Court  and  the  two  sets  of<br>defendants  filed  separate sets of cross  objections. The<br>High  Court confirmed the decree and the plaintiff's  second<br>appeal and the defendants' cross objections were  dismissed.<br>Withinsix months from the date of the High Court's  decree<br>the  plaintiff deposited in court the amount payable by him<br>and  applied for execution. Defendant 7 contended  that the<br>plaintiff  not having complied with the terms of the  decree<br>of   the  first appellate  court,  his rightto   recover<br>possession  in execution was. forfeited.  The  lower  courts<br>upheld the  defendant's  contention  and   dismissed the<br>darkhast.  On second appeal by the plaintiff, the High Court<br>reversed  the  decree of the lower court and held  that the<br>time for executing a decree nisi for possession ran from the<br>date of the High Court's decree confirming the decree of the<br>lower  court, for what was to be looked at  and interpreted<br>was the decree of the final appellate court.  There isalso<br>a decision to the similar effect in Sita v. Ramnath(2). For<br>the reasons  already  given wehold that the decree of the<br>High  Court  in Second Appeal  should be  construed  in the<br>present case as affording by implication a  fresh  starting<br>point to the plaintiff for making payment to the Court.<br>    For the  reasons  expressed we hold  thatthis  appeal<br>shouldbe allowed, the judgment of the, Bombay High  Court<br>dated October<br>(1) I.L.R. 39 Bom. 175.     (2) I.L.R. 28 Patna 371.<br>519<br>11/14,1963 should be set aside and the application of the<br>first  defendant  made on February 8, 1961  for restitution<br>under  s.  144of  the CivilProcedure  Code should  be<br>dismissed.  Inthe  circumstances of this case we  do not<br>propose to make any order as to costs of this appeal.<br>T.P.Appeal allowed.<br>520<br><br><br><br>"]'
